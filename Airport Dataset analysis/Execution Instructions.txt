Objectives
• Determine the number of flights from each airport; include a list of any airports not used.
• Create a list of flights based on the Flight id, this output should include the passenger Id, relevant IATA/FAA codes, the departure time, the arrival time (times to be converted to HH:MM:SS format), and the flight times.
• Calculate the number of passengers on each flight.
• Calculate the line-of-sight (nautical) miles for each flight and the total travelled by each passenger and thus output the passenger having earned the highest air miles.



The project can be compiled using Eclipse Command Line Arguments in Eclipse. 
Open Project -> AirportMain.java -> Run Configurations -> Arguments -> Create a path for the two datasets used and the output text file -> RUN
eg "C:\Users\diksh\eclipse-workspace\CC\bin\com\cloudcomputing\cw\AComp_Passenger_Data.csv C:\Users\diksh\eclipse-workspace\CC\bin\com\cloudcomputing\cw\Top30_airports_LatLong.csv output.txt"

Command Line Interface look like this: 
 C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.8.0_201\bin\javaw.exe -Dfile.encoding=Cp1252 -classpath "C:\Users\diksh\Google Drive\Reading University\Cloud Computing\Coursework\bin;C:\Users\diksh\Downloads\gson-2.6.2.jar" com.coursework.cc.AriportMain "C:\Users\diksh\eclipse-workspace\CC\bin\com\cloudcomputing\cw\AComp_Passenger_Data.csv" "C:\Users\diksh\eclipse-workspace\CC\bin\com\cloudcomputing\cw\Top30_airports_LatLong.csv" output.txt
