Objectives
• Determine the number of flights from each airport; include a list of any airports not used.
• Create a list of flights based on the Flight id, this output should include the passenger Id, relevant IATA/FAA codes, the departure time, the arrival time (times to be converted to HH:MM:SS format), and the flight times.
• Calculate the number of passengers on each flight.
• Calculate the line-of-sight (nautical) miles for each flight and the total travelled by each passenger and thus output the passenger having earned the highest air miles.
